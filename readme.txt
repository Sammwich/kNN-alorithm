- This is a self-made K-nearest neighbours (kNN) algorithm that I made in order to understand the process better

- used this tutorial as reference: http://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-to-implement-k-nearest-neighbors-in-python-from-scratch/

- the dataset is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) you can find it from (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/).
